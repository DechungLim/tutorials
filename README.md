* [ABBA BABA statistics using genome wide SNP data](https://github.com/simonhmartin/tutorials/tree/master/ABBA_BABA_whole_genome/README.md)<br>
A tutorial that explores the "*ABBA BABA*" *D* and *f* statistics, and how these can be applied using genome-scale SNP data, including significance testing using the block jackknife.

* [ABBA BABA analysis in sliding windows](https://github.com/simonhmartin/tutorials/tree/master/ABBA_BABA_windows/README.md)<br>
A tutorial on applying "*ABBA BABA*" statistics (specifically f<sub>d</sub> [Martin et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msu269) in sliding windows to quantify variation in the extent of introgression across the genome.

* [topology_weighting](https://github.com/simonhmartin/tutorials/tree/master/topology_weighting/README.md)<br>
A tutorial on topology weighting using [Twisst](https://github.com/simonhmartin/twisst) to explore evolutionary relationships across teh genome, as described in [Martin & Van Belleghem 2017](http://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.116.194720).
